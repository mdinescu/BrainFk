# BrainFk
A BrainFuck Interpreter in C++

The code represents a simple but full featured BrainFuck interpreter implementation in C++. It's packages as a VisualC++ project but it could easily be compiled with a different compiler, or even modified and retargeted for a different platform than Intel X86.

## The Language

From the Wikipedia entry on Brainfuck (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck):

> Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller, and notable for its extreme minimalism.
>
> The language consists of only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer. While it is fully Turing-complete, it is not  intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers. Brainfuck simply requires one to break commands into microscopic steps.

A Brainfuck program has an implicit byte pointer, called "the pointer", which is free to move around within an array of 30000 bytes, initially all set to zero. The pointer itself is initialized to point to the beginning of this array.

The Brainfuck programming language consists of eight commands, each of which is represented as a single character.

    > 	Increment the pointer.
    < 	Decrement the pointer.
    + 	Increment the byte at the pointer.
    - 	Decrement the byte at the pointer.
    . 	Output the byte at the pointer.
    , 	Input a byte and store it in the byte at the pointer.
    [ 	Jump forward past the matching ] if the byte at the pointer is zero.
    ] 	Jump backward to the matching [ unless the byte at the pointer is zero.

The semantics of the Brainfuck commands can also be succinctly expressed in terms of C, as follows (assuming that p has been previously defined as a char*):

    > 	becomes 	++p;
    < 	becomes 	--p;
    + 	becomes 	++*p;
    - 	becomes 	--*p;
    . 	becomes 	putchar(*p);
    , 	becomes 	*p = getchar();
    [ 	becomes 	while (*p) {
    ] 	becomes 	}
